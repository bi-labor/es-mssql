1. Take a look at the structure of the report, you should see the following sections:
    - Page header/footer: header/footer repeated for every physical page of the report
    - Report header/footer: header/footer present at the start of the actual report (a report template could contain multiple records)
    - Details: repeated for every entry (row) in the data set
    Drag and drop the date, Number of students, and Average grade to the details section, in the following pattern.

    Save this file as `ex5-report1.prpt`

    Create a screenshot of the report and save it as `ex5-report1.png`. Make sure that the title, including your Neptun code, the table and the bar chart is visible on this screenshot.
